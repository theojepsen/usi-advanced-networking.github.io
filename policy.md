# Honor Code

Although you are encouraged to discuss ideas with others, your programs are to be completed independently and must be your own, original work, or the work of you and your partners. Whenever you obtain significant outside help (from other students, the TAs, etc.) you should acknowledge this in your program write-up, e.g. “The idea for how to implement ARP decoding came from a discussion with Paola.”

If I detect any incidents of cheating, I will report them immediately to the department, and the assignment will be given a grade of 0.

# Grading

The emphasis is on developing the required functionality and achieving interoperability with other’s solutions. We will pay careful attention to your design document of who contributed what in each team!

*Deliverables*: If you are late for a deliverable, then you lose 2 points per day, up to 3 days late. After that you receive zero for that deliverable.  Over the semester each *team* has a total of 3 free late days that you can use however you want for any milestone without penalty.

Marks are awarded to an individual (I) or the team (T).
